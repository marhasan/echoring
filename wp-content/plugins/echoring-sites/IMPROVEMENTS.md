# EchoRing Sites Plugin - Admin Interface Improvements

## Overview

The EchoRing Sites plugin has been enhanced with a new WordPress-standard admin interface that provides a better user experience and follows WordPress best practices.

## New Features

### 1. WordPress WP_List_Table Integration

- **Standard WordPress Experience**: The new admin interface uses WordPress's built-in `WP_List_Table` class, providing a familiar experience consistent with other WordPress admin pages.

- Perform actions on multiple sites at once:
  - Mark as Updated

- "Select All" checkbox for easy bulk selection

#### Improved Modal Interface
